The text file has a small vocabulary:мама mother

Console reads words from the file and place it in HashMap. 
To read text from the file, uses a scanner.
Algorithm:
1. Reading the file line by line. Split each line with the split method (" "). 
2. Using this method to get an array of strings (the Russian word and the English word) from the single line "мама mother" place the Russian word in the form of a key in the HashMap, English word in the form of a value.
 Implementing the Russian-English and English-Russian versions.
 Made it possible to add a new word to file (using PrintWriter).
